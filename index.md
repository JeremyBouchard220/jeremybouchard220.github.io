## Welcome to Jeremy Bouchard's GitHub Page!

Hello everyone! As you can probably already tell, there isn't much on my page yet. I am still new into the Coding World but I am having a lot of fun with it so far. I can't wait to show everyone how my skill will expand and where I end up going!

### Projects

I'm not sure if I'm going to start my own projects or if I'll upload some school assignments or maybe even a bit of both. Either way, I hope you'll check back in to see what I've done as I progress my skills.

#### Future Goals

[] Complete a website to help artists not feel the axiety of possibly having their art stolen from them.

### Contact Me

If you'd like to reach out to me for any reason, feel free to drop me an email at jbouchard220@gmail.com and I'll get back to you as soon as I can!
